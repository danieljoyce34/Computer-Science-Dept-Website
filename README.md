#Computer Science Website Redesign

##Getting Started
**click** the button on the right side of the screen called 
>Clone in Desktop

Then download the associated app and install.

From there pick a place to put the local repository on your machine. Once it's cloned you can simply add your files directly to that folder, and using the github program previously installed, you can **commit** changes and **sync**

**Remember** you must give a title to **each** commit and a small description, please make these meaningful. Then hit **sync** to sync your changes to github.

####It's that easy

##When you commit

please put in a separate folder named appropriately so that we can keep it separate until it's time to stick it together.

**ResponsiveGridSystem** github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/grahammiller/ResponsiveGridSystem) for quick access.
