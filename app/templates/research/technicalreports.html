      <td style="padding-bottom: 25px;"> Abstract: Computability logic (see <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html">this http URL</a>) is a
long-term project for redeveloping logic on the basis of a constructive game
semantics, with games seen as abstract models of interactive computational
problems. Among the fragments of this logic successfully axiomatized so far is
CL12 --- a conservative extension of classical first-order logic, whose
language augments that of classical logic with the so called choice sorts of
quantifiers and connectives. This system has already found fruitful
applications as a logical basis for constructive and complexity-oriented
versions of Peano arithmetic, such as arithmetics for polynomial time
computability, polynomial space computability, and beyond. The present paper
introduces a third, indispensable complexity measure for interactive
computations termed amplitude complexity, and establishes the adequacy of CL12
with respect to A-amplitude, S-space and T-time computability under certain
minimal conditions on the triples (A,S,T) of function classes. This result very
substantially broadens the potential application areas of CL12. The paper is
self-contained, and targets readers with no prior familiarity with the subject.

      <td style="padding-bottom: 25px;"> In a recently launched research program for developing logic as a formal theory of (interactive) computability, several very interesting logics have been introduced and axiomatized. These fragments of the larger Computability Logic aim not only to describe "what" can be computed, but also provide a mechanism for extracting computational algorithms from proofs. Among the most expressive and fundamental of these is CL4, known to be (constructively) sound and complete with respect to the underlying computational semantics. Furthermore, the fragment of CL4 not containing blind quantifiers was shown to be decidable in polynomial space. The present work extends this result and proves that this fragment is, in fact, PSPACE-complete.  </td>

classical logic after replacing truth} by computability in its underlying

elaborates some basic complexity theory for the CoL framework. Then it proves
soundness and completeness for the deductive system CL12 with respect to the
semantics of CoL, including the version of the latter based on polynomial time
computability instead of computability-in-principle. CL12 is a sequent calculus
system, where the meaning of a sequent intuitively can be characterized as "the
succedent is algorithmically reducible to the antecedent", and where formulas
are built from predicate letters, function letters, variables, constants,
identity, negation, parallel and choice connectives, and blind and choice
quantifiers. A case is made that CL12 is an adequate logical basis for
constructive applied theories, including complexity-oriented ones.

arithmetic, but based on computability logic (see
<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html">this http URL</a>) instead of the more traditional
classical or intuitionistic logics. Formulas of clarithmetical theories
represent interactive computational problems, and their "truth" is understood

constraints on such solutions yields various versions of clarithmetic. The
present paper introduces a system of clarithmetic for polynomial time
computability, which is shown to be sound and complete. Sound in the sense that
every theorem T of the system represents an interactive number-theoretic
computational problem with a polynomial time solution and, furthermore, such a
solution can be efficiently extracted from a proof of T. And complete in the
sense that every interactive number-theoretic problem with a polynomial time
solution is represented by some theorem T of the system. The paper is written

      <td style="padding-bottom: 25px;"> Computability logic (CL) (see <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html">this http URL</a>) is a
recently introduced semantical platform and ambitious program for redeveloping
logic as a formal theory of computability, as opposed to the formal theory of
truth which logic has more traditionally been. Its expressions represent
interactive computational tasks seen as games played by a machine against the
environment, and "truth" is understood as existence of an algorithmic winning
strategy. With logical operators standing for operations on games, the
formalism of CL is open-ended, and has already undergone series of extensions.
This article extends the expressive power of CL in a qualitatively new way,
generalizing formulas (to which the earlier languages of CL were limited) to
circuit-style structures termed cirquents. The latter, unlike formulas, are
able to account for subgame/subtask sharing between different parts of the
overall game/task. Among the many advantages offered by this ability is that it
allows us to capture, refine and generalize the well known
independence-friendly logic which, after the present leap forward, naturally
becomes a conservative fragment of CL, just as classical logic had been known
to be a conservative fragment of the formula-based version of CL. Technically,
this paper is self-contained, and can be read without any prior familiarity
with CL.

termed toggling. The toggling operations can be characterized as lenient
versions of choice operations where choices are retractable, being allowed to
be reconsidered any finite number of times. This way, they model
trial-and-error style decision steps in interactive computation. The main

To obtain a model example of such theories, this paper rebuilds the traditional, classical-logic-based Peano arithmetic into a computability-logic-based counterpart. Among the purposes of the present contribution is to provide a starting point for what, as the author wishes to hope, might become a new line of research with a potential of interesting findings -- an exploration of the presumably quite unusual metatheory of CL-based arithmetic and other CL-based applied systems. </td>

The formalism of CL is open-ended, and may undergo series of extensions as the study of the subject advances. The main groups of operators on which CL has been focused so far are the parallel, choice, branching, and blind operators. The present paper introduces a new important group of operators, called sequential. The latter come in the form of sequential conjunction and disjunction, sequential quantifiers, and sequential recurrences. As the name may suggest, the algorithmic intuitions associated with this group are those of sequential computations, as opposed to the intuitions of parallel computations associated with the parallel group of operations: playing a sequential combination of games means playing its components in a sequential fashion, one after one.

      <td style="padding-bottom: 25px;"> Within the program of finding axiomatizations for various parts of computability logic, an earlier article proved that the logic of interactive Turing reduction is exactly the implicative fragment of Heyting's intuitionistic calculus. That sort of reduction permits unlimited reusage of the computational resource represented by the antecedent. An at least equally basic and natural sort of algorithmic reduction, however, is the one that does not allow such reusage. The present article shows that turning the logic of the first sort of reduction into the logic of the second sort of reduction takes nothing more than just deleting the contraction rule from its Gentzen-style axiomatization. The first (Turing) sort of interactive reduction is also shown to come in three natural versions. While those three versions are very different from each other, their logical behaviors (in isolation) turn out to be indistinguishable, with that common behavior being precisely captured by implicative intuitionistic logic.

formalized as games between a machine and its environment. Intuitionistic
implication is understood as algorithmic reduction in the weakest possible --
and hence most natural -- sense, disjunction and conjunction as
deterministic-choice combinations of problems (disjunction = machine's choice,
conjunction = environment's choice), and "absurd" as a computational problem of
universal strength. See <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html">

profiling information and procedure inlining to enable region formation analysis. This paper
presents an interprocedural compilation technique which performs procedure inlining on-demand,
rather than as a separate phase, to improve the ability of a region-based optimizer to control code
growth, compilation time and memory usage while improving performance. Experimental results are
presented to evaluate the impact of the algorithm and several inlining heuristics upon a number of

both for entertainment and as a possible career path, is a major reason for
the increasing prevalence of computer game design courses in computer science
curricula.  Because implementing a computer game requires strong programming
skills, game design courses are most often restricted to more advanced
computer science students.  This paper reports on a ready-made game design
and experimentation framework, implemented in Java, that makes game
programming more widely accessible.  This framework, called Labyrinth,
enables students at all programming skill levels to participate in computer
game design.  We describe the architecture of the framework, and discuss
programming projects suitable for a wide variety of computer science courses,
from capstone to non-major.  </td>

      <td style="padding-bottom: 25px;"> Computability logic (CL) is a systematic formal theory of 
computational tasks and resources, which, in a sense, 
can be seen as a semantics-based alternative to (the 
syntactically introduced) linear logic. With its 
expressive and flexible language, where formulas 
represent computational problems and "truth" is 
understood as algorithmic solvability, CL potentially 
offers a comprehensive logical basis for constructive 
applied theories and computing systems inherently 
requiring constructive and computationally meaningful 
underlying logics.
 
Among the best known constructivistic logics is Heyting's 
intuitionistic calculus INT, whose language can be seen 
as a special fragment of that of CL. The constructivistic 
philosophy of INT, however, has never really found an 
intuitively convincing and mathematically strict semantical 
justification. CL has good claims to provide such a 
justification and hence a materialization of Kolmogorov's 
known thesis "INT = logic of problems". The present 
paper contains a soundness proof for INT with respect 
to the CL semantics. It is expected to constitute 
part 1 of a two-piece series on the intuitionistic 
fragment of CL, with part 2 containing an anticipated 
completeness proof. A comprehensive online source on 
CL is available <a href="http://http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html">

      <td style="padding-bottom: 25px;"> Computability logic is a formal theory of computational tasks and resources.
Formulas in it represent interactive computational problems, and "truth" is
understood as algorithmic solvability. Interactive computational problems, in
turn, are defined as a certain sort games between a machine and its
environment, with logical operators standing for operations on such games.
Within the ambitious program of finding axiomatizations for incrementally rich
fragments of this semantically introduced logic, the earlier article "From
truth to computability I" proved soundness and completeness for system CL3,
whose language has the so called parallel connectives (including negation),
choice connectives, choice quantifiers, and blind quantifiers. The present
paper extends that result to the significantly more expressive system CL4 with
the same collection of logical operators. What makes CL4 expressive is the
presence of two sorts of atoms in its language: elementary atoms, representing
elementary computational problems (i.e. predicates, i.e. problems of zero
degree of interactivity), and general atoms, representing arbitrary
computational problems. CL4 conservatively extends CL3, with the latter being
nothing but the general-atom-free fragment of the former. Removing the blind
(classical) group of quantifiers from the language of CL4 is shown to yield a
decidable logic despite the fact that the latter is still first-order. A

      <td style="padding-bottom: 25px;"> This paper introduces a refinement of the sequent calculus approach called
cirquent calculus. While in Gentzen-style proof trees sibling (or cousin, etc.)
sequents are disjoint sequences of formulas, in cirquent calculus they are
permitted to share elements. Explicitly allowing or disallowing shared
resources and thus taking to a more subtle level the resource-awareness
intuitions underlying substructural logics, cirquent calculus offers much
greater flexibility and power than sequent calculus does. A need in
substantially new deductive tools came with the birth of computability logic
(see <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html">this http URL</a>) - the 
semantically constructed
formal theory of computational resources, which has stubbornly resisted any
axiomatization attempts within the framework of traditional syntactic
approaches. Cirquent calculus breaks the ice. Removing contraction from the
full collection of its rules yields a sound and complete system for the basic
fragment CL5 of computability logic. Doing the same in sequent calculus, on the
other hand, throws out the baby with the bath water, resulting in the strictly
weaker affine logic. An implied claim of computability logic is that it is CL5
rather than affine logic that adequately materializes the resource philosophy
traditionally associated with the latter. To strengthen this claim, the paper
further introduces an abstract resource semantics and shows the soundness and
completeness of CL5 with respect to it. </td>

      <td style="padding-bottom: 25px;"> In the same sense as classical logic is a formal theory of truth, the
recently initiated approach called computability logic is a formal theory of
computability. It understands (interactive) computational problems as games
played by a machine against the environment, their computability as existence
of a machine that always wins the game, logical operators as operations on
computational problems, and validity of a logical formula as being a scheme of
"always computable" problems. The present contribution gives a detailed
exposition of a soundness and completeness proof for an axiomatization of one
of the most basic fragments of computability logic. The logical vocabulary of
this fragment contains operators for the so called parallel and choice
operations, and its atoms represent elementary problems, i.e. predicates in the
standard sense. This article is self-contained as it explains all relevant
concepts. While not technically necessary, however, familiarity with the
foundational paper "Introduction to computability logic" [Annals of Pure and
Applied Logic 123 (2003), pp.1-99] would greatly help the reader in
understanding the philosophy, underlying motivations, potential and utility of
computability logic, -- the context that determines the value of the present

It traces the evolution of the database, from its start as a non-computerized
