  <h3>Computability Logic</h3>
</div>
<p>Computability is certainly one of the most interesting and fundamental concepts in mathematics and computer science, and it would be more than natural to ask what logic it induces. Let us face it: this question has not only never been answered, but never even been asked within a reasonably coherent and comprehensive formal framework. This is where Computability Logic comes in. It is a formal theory of computability in the same sense as classical logic is a formal theory of truth. In a broader and more proper sense, computability logic is not just a particular theory but an ambitious and challenging program for redeveloping logic following the scheme "from truth to computability". It was introduced in 2003 and, at present, still remains in its infancy stage, with open problems prevailing over answered questions. It is largely a virgin soil offering plenty of research opportunities, with good chances of interesting findings, for those with interests in logic and its applications in computer science.

  <h3>Cirquent Calculus</h3>
</div>
<p>Cirquent calculus is a new proof-theoretic and semantic framework, whose main distinguishing feature is being based on circuits, as opposed to the more traditional approaches that deal with tree-like objects such as formulas or sequents. Among its advantages are greater efficiency, flexibility and expressiveness. It is also is naturally and inherently resource conscious. Classical logic, both syntactically and semantically, is just a special, conservative fragment of this more general and, in a sense, more basic logic -- the logic of resources in the form of cirquent calculus. In publications on this subject the reader will find various arguments in favor of switching to the new framework, such as arguments showing the insufficiency of the expressive power of linear logic or other formula-based approaches to developing resource logics, exponential improvements over the traditional approaches in both representational and proof complexities offered by cirquent calculus, and more.

  <h3>Plagiarism Detection and Research Writing Validation</h3>
</div>
<p>We are developing a software tool to detect copy and paste plagiarism and to validate research writing.  The tool makes use of free search engine APIs to enable fast, practical and free checking of documents against content on the Internet to identify instances of intended or unintended plagiarism.

  <h3>Blogging use for Large Lectures</h3>
</div>
<p>Large lecture sessions make it difficult for individuals to have their voices heard. Additionally, freshman tend to be shy in any group and very unsure of the validity of their opinions. I investigated the use of Blogging as a technique for a non-csc majors' course.
