  <h3>Plagiarism Detection and Research Writing Validation</h3>
  <p>We are developing a software tool to detect copy and paste plagiarism and to validate research writing.  The tool makes use of free search engine APIs to enable fast, practical and free checking of documents against content on the Internet to identify instances of intended or unintended plagiarism.</p>

  <h3>Blogging use for Large Lectures</h3>
  <p>
    Large lecture sessions make it difficult for individuals to have their voices heard. Additionally, freshman tend to be shy in any group and very unsure of the validity of their opinions. I investigated the use of Blogging as a technique for a non-csc majors' course.
