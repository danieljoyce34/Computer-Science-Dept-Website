September 12, 2016<br />
Speaker: Marcelo Balduccini<br />
Title : Cybersecurity as Reasoning about Actions and Change<br />
<p>Speaker Bio : Dr. Balduccini is an Assistant Research Professor at the College of Computing and Informatics of Drexel University. His research interests are focused on artificial intelligence, and include knowledge representation and reasoning, reasoning about actions and change, natural language understanding, and constraint satisfaction. Dr. Balduccini’s recent projects include algorithms for efficient reasoning in hybrid qualitative-quantitative domains and semantics-intensive techniques for information retrieval. His research has been funded by DARPA, NASA, IARPA, as well as various companies and industrial consortia.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Drexel, he worked as a Principal Research Scientist at Kodak Research Laboratories, where he led projects focused on planning, scheduling, and workflow automation, and ranging from fundamental research to transition-to- practice. Dr. Balduccini is affiliated with the AJ Drexel Institute for Energy and the Environment and with the Drexel University Cybersecurity Institute. He has published over 70 refereed technical publications, including three book chapters, and has edited two volumes.

Speaker: Henry Baird<br />
Title: How to Work with Creative People<br />
<p>Speaker Bio:
Dr. Baird joined Lehigh in January 2004 after thirty years in industrial research as Principal Scientist and area manager at PARC (Palo Alto, CA), department head and Member of Research Staff at Bell Labs (Murray Hill, NJ), and member of technical staff at RCA Sarnoff Labs (Princeton, NJ).
He has published five books and over one hundred technical papers.  He holds ten patents.  He has been elected Fellow of the IEEE and of the IAPR, and he received an ICDAR Outstanding Contributions Award.  He earned a Ph.D. in EECS from Princeton Univ. in 1984.  He also holds a Masters degree in CS from Rutgers Univ., and a bachelors in Mathematics from Harvard College.

November 14, 2016<br />
Speaker: Chris Stuezle<br />
Title: Parallel Algorithms in GIS<br />
<p>Speaker Bio: Christopher’s research is in the areas of Geographic Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction. His work revolves around exploring the mathematics of terrain data through new terrain representations and statistical analysis.  He has authored several publications in both computer science and civil engineering. He has also helped design a group collaborative problem solving system involving identification of inexpensive, off-the-shelf laser pointers using their unique IR signatures.  Christopher joined Merrimack in the Fall 2012.
He received his Ph. D. in June, 2012 from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY in the area of Computer Graphics. He graduated with a B.A. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts in 2007.
