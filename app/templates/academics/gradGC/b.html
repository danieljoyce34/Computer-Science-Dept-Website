  <h3>Publicly Available Large Data Sets</h3>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Sai Sharanya Thandra</p>
  <p><strong>Advisor:</strong> Dr. Don Goelman</p>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> In the current atmosphere of interest in â€œBig Dataâ€ and â€œData Science,â€ the accessibility of large data sets for research and educational purposes is of great importance. In this study I will discuss and classify a number of such publicly accessible data sets, including their structure (probably XML or JSON), their sizes and their contents. I will continue by describing the WEKA tool and illustrate how it can be used to extract information from such sets.</p>
