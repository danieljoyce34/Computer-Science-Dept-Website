  <h2>Graduate Grand Challenges - Evaluation</h2>



<p>All deliverables are due at the end of the semester in which you sign

  up for your Grand Challenges project. Approximately <em>two weeks before

the beginning of exams</em>, you should submit the following to your advisor:</p>



<ul>

  <li>An electronic copy of your report</li>

  <li>At the discretion of your advisor, two (or three) printed, unbound copies of your final report for departmental binding.</li>

  <li>Any other materials (such as software) appropriate for your project;

  discuss the complete set of deliverables with your advisor.</li>

</ul>



<p>At your advisor's request, We will bind hard copies of your final report. 

Typically one is kept by your

  advisor, and another is kept in the department archives. If you provide a

  third printed copy, we will bind that one as well and send it to you at no

  additional charge. The printed copies you submit must NOT be stapled or

bound in any way other than binder clips or rubber bands. And the cover page should adhere 

to the posted <a href="http://hawk.csc.villanova.edu/~IndStudy/titlePageTemplate.doc">Title Page Template</a></p>



<p>Your advisor is solely responsible for assigning your grade for the

Grand Challenges course. However, your advisor must report those grades

  to the GC Coordinator no later than the beginning of final exams. Therefore,

  advisors need time to carefully evaluate the project materials and read

  the final report, and often insist on having two weeks to do so. However,

  the specific deadline for getting your materials to your advisor can be

worked out between the two of you.</p>



<p>Do NOT make your advisor track you down. It is YOUR responsibility to

  contact your advisor as the semester deadline draws near. If you are having

  trouble completing your GC project work on time, you may be eligible for an 

  <a href="/gradGC/extensions">extension</a>, but

  you must contact your advisor well ahead of the end of the semester to

  request it. If you do not contact your advisor as the end of the semester

  draws near you will be dropped from the course and have to sign up for it

again in a future semester, paying full tuition.</p>



<p>There is no good reason for an Grand Challenges project to receive a

  poor grade, but unfortunately it sometimes happens. There are three main

problems students have regarding GC projects that result in low grades:</p>



<ul>

  <li>Procrastination</li>

  <li>Not keeping their advisor informed</li>

  <li>Violating academic integrity</li>

</ul>



<p>The trouble with Grand Challenges projects is that they are independent.

  Unless your advisor is the strong hands-on type, no one will be standing

  over you saying that a particular deliverable is due on a certain day.

  Because of the lack of intermediate deadlines, the rest of your life can

  tend to get in the way. Too many past students have allowed the semester

  deadline to approach without making satisfactory progress, and their final

  results are hurried and inadequate. You MUST avoid the trap of procrastination.

  Find the time to make steady progress on your project, just as you would

  if it were a regular course meeting weekly. If you find yourself unable

  to create a schedule that results in steady progress, request that your

advisor take a stronger role in setting intermediate deadlines.</p>



<p>One of the worst things you can do is leave your advisor out of the loop

  as you work on your GC project. There is a strong correlation between high

  Grand Challenges project grades and the interaction a student has with

  his or her advisor. Limited interaction is often detrimental to the project

  and the final grade. You may think you're proceeding as planned, but your

  advisor may have other assumptions. Or you may want to shift the emphasis

  of your topic, which is often fine, but only if your advisor is part of

the decision to do so.</p>



<p>Most advisors are happy to read early drafts of your final report and

  suggest changes. That type of interaction usually results in projects of

  high quality that meet your advisor expectations. In these cases the final

  evaluation that your advisor performs becomes a rubber stamp. But to

  accomplish this you must (1) avoid procrastination and (2) keep your

advisor informed of your project.</p>

  is such an important issue we've given it a full discussion in another

section of this site. Make sure you read that page carefully.</p>
