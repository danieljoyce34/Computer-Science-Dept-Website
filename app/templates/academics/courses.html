    <p>Deep inside your laptop is the digital-analog converter. It's the chip that takes strings of bits and converts them to the music or other audio you hear from the speakers. But how do you get the right strings of bits to make a clarinet or aguitar or a snare drum? This course combines the study of music structure and theory with an exploration of the programming structures, algorithms and language so that you can create music on your laptop. By the end of the course, the VLORK (Villanova Laptop Orchestra) should be in full voice.</p>

    <p>Deep inside your laptop is the digital-analog converter.  It's the chip that takes strings of bits and converts them to the music or other audio you hear from the speakers.  But how do you get the right strings of bits to make a clarinet or aguitar or a snare drum?  This course combines the study of music structure and theory with an exploration of the programming structures, algorithms and language so that you can create music on your laptop.  By the end of the course, the VLORK (Villanova Laptop Orchestra) should be in full voice.</p>
