(1, 'Jason Dobies, known as "Jay" or "General", graduated from Villanova as a Computer Science and Mathematics major in 2001. During his junior and senior years he interned with Lockheed Martin as a visual basic programmer. After graduating from Villanova he worked for five different companies within five years. For the past four years however, he has settled in with Red Hat as a senior software engineer. He enjoys this job because of the freedom it provides as well as the pride that the company has in its workers. Red Hat makes open source software easier to use for other major corporations. <p>While working for Red Hat, Jay realized how much he wanted to help other people. He believes that teaching is a great way to fulfill that ambition. After earning Masters in Software Engineering from Drexel University he applied to teach at Villanova. In the Spring of 2008 he started teaching Data Structures and Algorithms II. He is able to incorporate real world examples that he sees day to day in his work at Red Hat into his classroom. He also supplies the students with personal advice on surviving college and choosing a job or internship. <p>Jay is happily married to his wife (duh), whom he met during his junior year at Villanova (they were married in the Villanova Church). They are currently living in New Jersey with their two-year old daughter. If you ever need a good laugh or advice, you can catch him on campus on Tuesdays and Thursdays, usually sitting in the Connelly Center.', 'Jason Dobies', '2010-01-15 14:56:18', 0, 749, 2),

The\r\nGrocerEZ Program seeks to eliminate these\r\nannoyances with the ability to craft a grocery list\r\norganized by the aisles of the local store selected by\r\nthe user. On print out, the program would print out\r\nthe user’s list with associated aisles along with any\r\ncoupons online that were selected. With a database\r\nmaintaining the information behind the scenes, the\r\nuser is also given the ability to easily customize the\r\ninformation about their local stores if the store\r\nreorganizes its inventory.

While almost everyone can update their facebooks and twitters on their phones, we are providing another way in which you can express yourself. Using a microcontroller, users will now be able to update their statuses and tweets using Morse code. Imagine yourself in a situation where you are unable to look at your keyboard for proper typing, or need to free up one of your hands while tweeting. Morse code is simple and only requires two characters, dots and dashes, to get your message across. Using Arduino, we will program the microcontroller to accept dots and dashes from two different buttons. Our software will then convert the dots and dashes into the intended message and post to facebook or twitter. Our project will make it easier and more fun to update your statuses and tweets.', NULL, NULL, 0, 1182, 4),

(28, 'Taylor Clifton\r\n\r\nYapl (Yet another Programming Language) is a superset of the ECMA 262 programming language specification, specifically the JavaScript implementation.  Yapl aims to simplify JavaScript by stripping out tedious semantic and syntactic boilerplate, while also providing higher levels of expressiveness with far less code.  Yapl adds both original features and elements borrowed from other modern programming languages such as Ruby.   Its design focuses on providing a syntax that is clean, unobtrusive, the overall goal being to maximize the expressiveness of the language and minimize the size of the source code.\r\n\r\nYapl removes much of JavaScript’s unnecessary boilerplate syntax and semantics in favor of more concise, terse, and cleaner code.  Its syntax ends up very closely resembling that of Ruby’s.  Aside from syntax, Yapl still aims to preserve all of JavaScript’s features, and also adds both original features and features inspired by other languages, such as Ruby and Python.\r\n\r\nYapl’s primary execution environment is client-side web applications.  All major browsers in use today support JavaScript as their primary client-side scripting language, which means that Yapl will first and foremost compile to JavaScript.  Compiling to JavaScript means developers can use Yapl to write client-side web applications, with the resulting compiled code being served to the browser.  There are also projects that allow JavaScript to be run out of the context of a browser, such as Rhino and Node.js, meaning Yapl does not necessarily run exclusively in the browser context.', NULL, NULL, 0, 1184, 4),

There is also a way to comment on thoughts and report them. The website contains various filters which can show such things as which posts are most popular or controversial. Comments can also be agreed or disagreed with but only appear within a post. This anonymous thought board would be a good way to know what the student body is thinking and how they feel about certain things at the university or surrounding area. The main focus of this application is anonymity. The anonymous quality is something which would be valued when compared to a social network such as  Facebook.

(30, 'Kristin Arcurio\r\n\r\nFor my senior project I am building a web site for a band called Future Games. The page can be found here: www.futuregamesband.com. In addition I am creating a site editor for the band members to make updates to their web site whenever they would like. The band will have a user name and password to access this editor, and once logged in, will be presented with a user-friendly interface to change information like biography, show information, music, photos, and videos. Since I am connecting the site to a MySQL database, the editor is basically a front end way to edit database content, allowing changes to be immediately viewable on the band homepage.  Also for this project, I will be researching SEO, good web design practices, in terms of site content and UX, specifically for band websites, as well as new social media ideas to incorporate. I hope to create an optimal way for fans to interact with a band via web site, as well as a fully customizable site which band members can easily edit.', NULL, NULL, 0, 1186, 4);
