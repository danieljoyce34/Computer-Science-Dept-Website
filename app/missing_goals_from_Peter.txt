Goals of this branch,

-filling out static content pages for nav bar link
-adding jinja templating and inheritance for all of the pages to reduce overused code


Issues,

-in routing, the '/support/<path:pagename> needs to be written as '/support:<path:pagename'. though this is ugly currently it is the best way to do this while keeping the urls "clean". Can be done with GET requests but it's easier to just use the urls routing capability.

-Still needs the opportunities, events, research, and academic pages filled out.


-The main index page, still doesn't extend the pageFrameTemplate.html page, it requires this and is an easy fix.
